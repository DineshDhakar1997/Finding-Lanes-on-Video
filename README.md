# Finding-Lanes-on-Video

One of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project Lane Lines are detected in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for processing/analyzing images.

Developed a self-driving car lane detection system using Python and OpenCV, implementing Canny edge detection and Hough transform for robust lane line identification.

Successfully processed road images and videos, creating a pipeline to draw averaged lane lines, contributing to improved navigation in autonomous driving scenarios.

Demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, with a focus on computer vision techniques, resulting in an effective solution for real-time lane detection in self-driving environments.
