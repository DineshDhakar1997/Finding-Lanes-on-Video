# Finding-Lanes-on-Video

One of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project Lane Lines are detected in images using Python and OpenCV. OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for processing/analyzing images.
